Kubernetes consists of below components

1- API server (listen to kubectl command and other request)

2- etdc - distributed database to manage master and worker node.

3- Scheduler - responsible for assigning work to master and worker nodes, looks for new container and assign them to 
               worker node.

4- Controller - Brain of the kubernetes, when nodes/pods/cluster etc goes down, controller comes into play and start 
				starts the new one if required.

		/**
		* Above four components resides in Master node.
		*/	
				
5- Container Runtime - underline software on which container applications run, in most of the cases it Docker.
		     But there are some other options as well like rkt etc.

6- Kubelete - These are the agent running on each container to insure the each node is running as expected.

		* Above three components resides in Master node.
