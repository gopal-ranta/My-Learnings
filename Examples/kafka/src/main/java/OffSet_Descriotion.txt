There are two typs of offset in kafka
1- current offset - maintain by partition for not sending duplicate records by consumer
   This offset means that till here records have bean read by the consumer.
   
2- Committed offset - This offset means that how many records of the partition have been 
   successfully processed and committed by the consumer. This is critical in case of consumer
   re-balancing.In case the re-balancing happens this offset tells the new member where to 
   records read from. 
   
Commit types:
1- Auto commit(default) - two properties
   enable.auto.commit
   auto.commit.interval.ms
   problem with this type of commit is that messages can be reprocessed by the consumer
   in case the commit period has not passed and re-balancing happens.

2- Manual commit -
   a- sync commit - this commit retries if commit fails, so this most reliable but a blocking method
   	  so this reduces the throughput.
   b - Async commit - This commit dont retries if commit fails, because some afterwards commit happens
       to be successful, there is no need to commit the previous failed commit.
       
Note : If consumer goes down after processing the records and before committing the offset, 
	   in that case we can use database to maintain the processed recods and committed offset and 
	   make these two methods (processing the records and committing the offset) transactional.
